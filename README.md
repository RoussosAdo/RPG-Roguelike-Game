## 🧠 Development Process

The game was designed from scratch using **Miro** to map all gameplay systems, mechanics, and interactions.

### 📌 Design Planning (Miro)
🔗 [View Full Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLNVe_G4=/?share_link_id=689210783040)


### Core Categories:
- 🎮 Player State Machine (movement, skills, attacks, parry, dash)
- 🧙‍♂️ Enemy State Machine (idle, move, chase, attack)
- 🧰 Inventory, Equipment, Item Drops
- 🔥 Elemental Combat (fire, ice, poison, thunder)
- 🧪 Stat Scaling & Magic Affinity
- 🎨 UI Planning (health, mana, skill trees)
- 🎮 Skill System (sword throw, black hole, clone summon)
- 💾 Save/Load and Scene Transitions
- 🎧 Audio Manager (area sound, hit sounds, ambient tracks)

Each element in the Miro board was directly implemented using Unity systems, Animator, scriptable objects, custom inspectors, and serialization.

## 🧠 From Idea to Game

> 💡 “With the storyline that I created and with the diagrams above, I transformed the concept into a full Unity game.  
I built each element step-by-step, keeping the entire system organized using Miro, and then implemented them with care into Unity, coding every core mechanic from scratch.”
